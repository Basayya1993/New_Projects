# Check the validity of password input by users
 
# How It Works:
### The program defines a function valid_password(password): 
#### This function checks if the password meets all the specified criteria:
#### Length between 6 and 12 characters.
#### At least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character from $#@.
#### register_user(): This function prompts the user for a username and password and uses the is_valid_password function to validate the password.
#### If the password is valid, it confirms successful registration; otherwise, it provides details on why the registration failed.

### To Run the Program:
#### Copy the code into a Python environment.
#### Run the program and follow the prompts to enter a username and password.
